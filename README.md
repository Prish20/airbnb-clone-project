# StayBackend: Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview

StayBackend: Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack Airbnb clone project aimed at providing a robust platform for managing property listings, user profiles, bookings, payments, and reviews.
The goal is to build a scalable backend that supports both RESTful APIs and GraphQL, allowing flexible interaction for various clients (web, mobile).

### Project Goals

- User Management: Secure registration, login, and profile handling.
- Property Management: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
- Booking System: Allow users to reserve properties with detailed tracking.
- Payment Processing: Manage transactions securely.
- Review System: Enable users to leave feedback on properties.
- Data Optimization: Ensure fast and efficient access to data.

## Team Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
|:---|:---|
| Backend Developer | Develop REST and GraphQL APIs, implement core business logic, ensure server-side security. |
| Database Administrator | Design, maintain, and optimize the PostgreSQL database, manage indexes and queries for performance. |
| DevOps Engineer | Set up CI/CD pipelines, deploy applications using Docker, manage server infrastructure and scaling. |
| QA Engineer | Create automated and manual tests, ensure API functionality, handle bug tracking and quality assurance. |

## Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose in Project |
|:---|:---|
| Django | A high-level Python web framework for rapid backend development, REST APIs, and admin interface. |
| Django REST Framework | Simplifies building RESTful APIs for CRUD operations across users, properties, bookings, and payments. |
| GraphQL | Allows flexible, efficient client-server data interactions, enabling specific queries. |
| PostgreSQL | A powerful relational database to store all project data securely. |
| Celery | Handles asynchronous tasks like sending notifications and processing payments. |
| Redis | Provides fast in-memory caching to speed up data retrieval and handle session management. |
| Docker | Containerizes the app for consistent deployment across different environments. |
| CI/CD Pipelines | Automates testing and deployment processes to ensure quick, error-free releases. |

## Database Design

| Entity | Key Fields | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| User | id, name, email, password, profile_photo | Users of the platform. Can be guests or hosts. |
| Property | id, title, description, location, price_per_night, owner_id | Properties listed for rental by hosts. |
| Booking | id, user_id, property_id, check_in, check_out, total_price | Booking information linking users to properties. |
| Payment | id, booking_id, amount, payment_method, payment_status | Details of transactions related to bookings. |
| Review | id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment, created_at | Reviews left by users after their stay. |

### Entity Relationships

- A **User** can have multiple **Properties**.
- A **Booking** belongs to one **User** and one **Property**.
- A **Payment** is tied to one **Booking**.
- A **Review** belongs to both a **User** and a **Property**.

---

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**
  Registration, login, profile updates, and authentication to secure user accounts.

- **Property Management**
  Hosts can list properties, update details, and remove listings when necessary.

- **Booking System**
  Users can search for properties, book stays, view their booking history, and manage their reservations.

- **Payment Processing**
  Integration with payment services to handle secure transactions during bookings.

- **Review System**
  Guests can leave reviews and ratings after stays, helping maintain platform trustworthiness.

- **Database Optimization**
  Use of indexing and caching to ensure the system scales and remains performant even with large datasets.

## API Security Overview

| Security Measure | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| Authentication | Verifies the identity of users through secure login mechanisms (e.g., token-based authentication). |
| Authorization | Controls access to resources, ensuring users can only act on their own data. |
| Rate Limiting | Prevents abuse of API endpoints by limiting the number of requests per user. |
| Data Validation | Ensures that only valid and safe data enters the system, preventing common attacks (e.g., SQL Injection). |

### Why Security Matters

- Protects sensitive user information (emails, passwords).
- Secures payment data and financial transactions.
- Ensures platform integrity and builds trust among users.

## CI/CD Pipeline Overview

### What is CI/CD?

- **CI (Continuous Integration)** ensures that every code commit is automatically tested.
- **CD (Continuous Deployment)** automates the deployment of new versions without manual intervention.

### Tools to Use

- GitHub Actions: For automating builds, tests, and deployments from GitHub.
- Docker: For creating containers that encapsulate the application environment.
- AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean: For hosting and scaling backend services.

### Why It’s Important

- Reduces human error during deployment.
- Speeds up the release cycle.
- Provides quick feedback on the health of the application.
